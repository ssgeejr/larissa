Ansible can generally manage Windows versions under current and extended support from Microsoft. Ansible can manage desktop OSs including Windows 7, 8.1, and 10, and server OSs including Windows Server 2008, 2008 R2, 2012, 2012 R2, 2016, and 2019.

Ansible requires PowerShell 3.0 or newer and at least .NET 4.0 to be installed on the Windows host.

A WinRM listener should be created and activated. More details for this can be found below.
